Hello! This is a small project part of the Odin Project course. This project aims to show and demonstrate my knowledge of the basics:

- HTML Boilerplate
- Linking the CSS file to the HTML file so they can interact with each other
- How to link to other HTML files in the code-base
- The use of other additional HTML elements

For this project, I will be creating a basic recipe page, displaying a recipe on a HTML page, with a link to other recipes. The recipes will provide links which allow the user to navigate through the different recipes available. Each recipe will be displayed in plain text using HTML, with a basic structure provided using HTML elements to create a human-readable recipe page.
