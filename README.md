Hello! This is a small project part of the Odin Project course. This project aims to show and demonstrate my knowledge of the basics:

- HTML Boilerplate
- How to link to other HTML files in the code-base
- The use of other additional HTML elements

For this project, I will be creating a basic recipe page, displaying a recipe on a HTML page, with links to other recipes. The pages of recipes will have links allowing the user to navigate themselves to view the multiple recipe files in the project. Each recipe will be displayed in simple HTML using a basic boilerplate structure, with some other more advanced HTML elements. 

The final result produced will be a composed project full of recipes, with links that allow the user to view and read about multiple recipes in a human readable format.
